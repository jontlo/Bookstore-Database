        Rage Against the Page is a locally owned and operated, independent bookstore with a single 
        location in Boston. They sell their products in person only, and over the last few months, 
        their business has been growing rapidly due to community engagement and quality of 
        face-to-face customer service. Rage Against the Page brings in roughly $1 million in annual 
        sales, keeping an average of 10,000 - 12,000 books in stock at all times, with 
        16,000 - 19,000 units present on shelves and in backstock. Due to their rapid growth, their 
        impressively complicated excel spreadsheet is no longer sufficient to manage their business. 
        They are in need of a database driven back-end to track their inventory of Books, keep 
        records of Employee information, and be capable of recording 60,000 Sales of individual books 
        annually. In addition to this, they would like to be able to search their inventory based on 
        Authors, Publishers, and Genres, as well as receive sales reports. They are not concerned 
        with tracking customers themselves, but rather just the books sold. Sales will be attributed 
        to specific employees.
